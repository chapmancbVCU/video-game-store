The login page is the standard login setup with a remember me checkbox. Once you login you can access parts of the application that are allowed for your access control level. The number of failed attempts allowed can be set by your administrator. If you are an administrator and you get locked out and there are no other administrators you can set the inactive field to 0 and login_attempts to 0 in the record associated with your user account.
